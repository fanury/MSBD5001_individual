# model
Using nn which has 2 layers. Each layer has 750 neural units. 

# This is MSBD5001 individual project in HKUST

# Description
This competition is about modeling the performance of computer programs. The dataset provided describes a few examples of running SGDClassifier in Python. The features of the dataset describes the SGDClassifier as well as the features used to generate the synthetic training data. The data to be analyzed is the training time of the SGDClassifier.

# Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric used is mean-squared error. Lower error leads to a higher ranking.
